# switches

Program was inspired by this blog site: https://datagenetics.com/blog/march22021/index.html  

This program asks the user for a total number of switches, which all are set to off in the beginning. In each turn of the algoritm, a random switch is set to ON if the switch is OFF or OFF is the switch is ON. This program continues this loop until all switches are set to ON, as the image below shows.
